# Making methodology decisions

***Total suggested time: 45 minutes***

## Class exercise: Combining data and methodologies

*Suggested time: 20 minutes*

As a class, [open a new Google Sheet](https://sheet.new) and – like before – create two sheets with the following names:
* data
* methodology

In this spreadsheet, you'll work as a class to combine the data into a summary file to get a look across all states **together**.

Just like you did in small groups with individual states, start with a **structure** for the data you want to capture in the `data` sheet. And consider:
* What does each row of data observe?
* For each row/observation, what fields are you capturing in each column?

Use `methodology` sheet to keep notes describing how you're capturing your data. List each of your fields and include a short description. You can also provide any other details of the decisions you make.

## Class discussion: How does it compare?

*Suggested time: 25 minutes*

* How does your final product compare to the fields used by the COVID Tracking project in [its summary data file](https://covidtracking.com/data/download/national-history.csv)?
* What details and measurements are lost when adding data across states?
* How trustworthy is the data you aggregated across states?
* How would you communicate or explain the uncertainty in the data to your audience?
