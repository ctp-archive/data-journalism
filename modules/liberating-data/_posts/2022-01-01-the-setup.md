Students will be able to:

* Identify situations where data is missing, incomplete or encumbered
* Translate unstructured data from various sources to structured spreadsheet data
* Weigh methodological choices for collecting data, given time and resource constraints
* Design and implement systems for collecting data
* Evaluate how methodological choices for collecting data can impact analysis

## Recommended pacing

## What you'll need for this module

* An Internet connection and Web browser
* A Google account and access to Google Sheets
