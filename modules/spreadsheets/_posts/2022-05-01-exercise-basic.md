## Spreadsheet basics - Class exercises

With the data you've prepared, see if you can answer the following **[small questions](http://127.0.0.1:4000/modules/spreadsheets/interviewing-your-data/)** as a class:

* During the first year of the pandemic, when did new COVID cases peak in New York?
* When did the spread of the virus seem to be ebbing?
* When did hospitalizations peak?
* What about deaths?
* What sort of relationships did the peaks of cases, hospitalizations and death seem to have?

And for discussion:
* What measure should you use to define "peak" COVID?
