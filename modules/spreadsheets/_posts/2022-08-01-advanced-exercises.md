# Advanced spreadsheets - Class exercises

Using pivot tables, see if you can answer the following [small questions](http://127.0.0.1:4000/modules/spreadsheets/interviewing-your-data/) as a class:

* Which Connecticut town saw the largest number of COVID-19 cases?
* What about deaths?
* Which town saw the highest rate of COVID-19 deaths per patient?
* Which town saw the highest rate of COVID-19 deaths per population?
* When you divide cities by facility category (assisted living vs. nursing homes) how do the highest rates of death per patient compare?

And for discussion:

* Why might our "infection rate per patient" measure be flawed?
* What factors might complicate comparisons or rankings between long-term care facilities?
* Why were the death rates between federally regulated and state-regulated facilities so different?
