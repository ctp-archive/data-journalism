## Lecture: Treating data as a source
*Suggested time: 5 minutes*

As we will say a lot in this course, data is as fallible as any other source. 

As journalists, our job is to **interview our data**. But we don't have to be experts to do that. Start with small questions.

Here are a few:
* What do the **descriptive statistics** show?
	* Counts and sums – How many and how much.
	* Average – The sum of all values, divided by the number of values.
	* Median – The middle value of a sorted range of numbers. Also called the typical value.
	* Quartiles – Where the median breaks a sorted list into two halves, quartiles break up into four. 
* How **many times** did something occur?
* Over what **time period**? Are there chronological **patterns**?
* What are the **biggest** or **smallest** values?
* What's happening **nearby**? On your **beat**?
* How do things **compare** by category? Subcategory?
* What's **missing**? Where are the **gaps**?
