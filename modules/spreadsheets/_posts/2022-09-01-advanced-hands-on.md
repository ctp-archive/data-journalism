# Advanced spreadsheets - Hands-on exercises

In small groups, investigate whether the population of Connecticut facilities might have impacted the number of deaths due to COVID-19.

## Explore

* Examine the data you have on the number of patients in each Connecticut facility and determine numerical cutoffs to categorize each facility into one of four sizes based on the patient population: tiny, small, medium and large.
* In your source data, create a new column and write a formula to categorize each facility into your categories.
* Create a pivot table comparing the rates of death for each size group.
* As a group, write a single sentence explaining, as simply as possible, what your analysis shows.


## Discussion

After 15-20 minutes, students should share their sentences and discuss:

* Why did you choose the population cutoffs you did?
* Did different choices yield different results?
* What about the operation of these facilities might explain your findings?
* What other data not currently part of your analysis might help explain the trends you noticed across categories of facilities, size, etc.?
