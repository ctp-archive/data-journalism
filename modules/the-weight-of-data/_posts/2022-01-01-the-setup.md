# The setup

Data is more than just numbers â€“ it's an attempt to quantify often emotional aspects of humanity, like loss and illness. Data journalists should be prepared for the implications of working with and presenting these numbers, both on themselves and their audiences.

## Module objectives

* Critique the techniques data journalists use to portray issues of life and death in existing work
* Predict potential effects of data reporting on audiences
* Discuss potential impacts of covering traumatic subjects on data reporters or others involved in data collection
* Formulate best practices for large-scale data journalism projects
* Develop plans for future reporting projects using lessons from the COVID Tracking Project

## Recommended pacing
