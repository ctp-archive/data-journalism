# Working with traumatic data

***Total suggested time: 50 minutes***

## Class discussion: Who did you hear from?

*Suggested time: 20 minutes*

After students have listened to the oral histories on their own, devote all or a portion of the next class to guided discussion, starting with students sharing their main takeaways from one or more of the oral histories they reviewed.

## Class discussion: Confronting trauma

*Suggested time: 30 minutes*

As a class, have students explore the links between the subjects of their oral histories by answering some of the following questions.

* Across the oral histories that you reviewed, what did CTP volunteers **have in common**?
* Were any volunteers you heard from **personally affected** by COVID? How did that impact their participation?
* What **positive impacts** do you think volunteers experienced while working with CTP? What about **negative impacts**?
* As an organization, how did CTP handle the **traumatic aspects** of doing this work?
* What lessons can we take from the experience of the COVID Tracking Project for other types of **potentially traumatic** journalism work?
