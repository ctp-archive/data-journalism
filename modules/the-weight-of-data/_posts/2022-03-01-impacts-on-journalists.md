# Working with traumatic data

As the COVID Tracking Project wound down in the early months of 2021, the organizers of the project took steps to archive essentially everything they had collected, documented and communicated over their more than year's worth of effort. Part of that process was recording dozens of oral histories with members of the volunteer force behind the project, from the founders to the individuals who entered the data.

In these oral histories, you'll hear first-hand about the impacts of the project â€“ and what it meant to do this work amid the trauma of the pandemic.

## Before class

On their own, students should review **two to three oral histories of their choice** available online through the COVID Tracking Project Archive at the University of California, San Fransisco Archives and Special Collections:
* [50+ oral histories from the COVID Tracking Project](https://calisphere.org/collections/28036/)

As they listen, students should consider the following questions and be prepared to share their thoughts with the class:
* What **roles** did the subjects of your oral histories play in the COVID Tracking Project?
* What **stood out** or **surprised you** about their involvement with the project?
* How did participating in the project **impact** them personally?
* How did they **take care of themselves** during their time at the project?
* What did the end of the project **mean** for them?

## In class

After students have listened to the oral histories on their own, devote all or a portion of the next class to guided discussion, starting with students sharing their main takeaways from one or more of the oral histories they reviewed.

Consider summarizing the discussion by answering some of the following questions as a class.

* Across the oral histories that you reviewed, what did CTP volunteers **have in common**?
* Were any volunteers you heard from **personally affected** by COVID? How did that impact their participation?
* What **positive impacts** do you think volunteers experienced while working with CTP? What about **negative impacts**?
* As an organization, how did CTP handle the **traumatic aspects** of doing this work?
* What lessons can we take from the experience of the COVID Tracking Project for other types of **potentially traumatic** journalism work?
