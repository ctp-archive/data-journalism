# Data viz - Class exercises

With what you've learned so far, see if you can create the following visualizations as a class:

* Create a line chart examining the rolling averages of new cases in California that's limited to the dates during the 2020 winter peak.
* Modify your line chart to include three to five other states of your choice for comparison.
* Create a state-specific chart of California showing both daily deaths and the seven-day rolling average of deaths.

Individually, take 5-10 minutes to find several examples of coverage during the winter 2020 surge of COVID in California.

* How did news organizations cover the surge?
* In what ways were the visualizations they used effective at communicating the surge?
