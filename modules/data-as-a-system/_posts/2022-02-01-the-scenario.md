For weeks, nations across the globe have kept close watch on the spread of a new virus spreading rapidly both within and across their borders.

Now, the World Health Organization has declared this "Z virus" a **global pandemic**.

There's a lot scientists don't know yet about the Z virus and how it spreads, and they've only recently figured out how to reliably **test for it**. But early indications are that it's highly communicable and more lethal than the flu, especially since as a novel virus the human population has no natural immunity to it.

It's Day One of the pandemic in the United States of America, and you have a job to do.
