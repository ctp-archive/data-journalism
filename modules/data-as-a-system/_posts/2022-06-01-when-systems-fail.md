# When systems fail

***Total Suggested time: 45 minutes***

## Class discussion: Fixing flawed systems

After students have listened to the podcast on their own, devote all or a portion of the next class to a guided discussion about the content, using all or some of following questions in class.

> **For instructors:** As you guide the discussion, try steering portions of the conversation from "understanding" questions to "evaluation" questions to build the complexity of students' learning.

### 'Understanding' questions
*Suggested time: 15 minutes*
* Why did the federal government collect data about COVID-19 the way it did?
* What data was missing?
* In what ways did data collection break down between states and the federal government?
* What potential flaws existed in data published by the COVID Tracking Project?

### 'Application' questions
*Suggested time: 15 minutes*
* What surprised you about the government's methodology for tracking the spread of the coronavirus?
* How did the government's systems for tracking COVID-19 compare to the systems you sketched in class?

### 'Evaluation' questions
*Suggested time: 15 minutes*
* How perfect does data have to be to be useful?
* How do the flaws in data collection of COVID-19 impact our understanding of the disease and its impact?
* As data journalists, how important is understanding the system – how data is collected – when reporting on what the data tells us?
