# Systems thinking - Hands-on exercises

The United States needs a plan for detecting the spread of the Z virus, and the goal of this exercise is for your class to draft one on paper.

## Part I - Division of power

Students should split into groups of two or three. Assign each group a different U.S. state.

As a group, students should take about 15 minutes to sketch out a system for testing individuals **within their state jurisidiction only** for the Z virus. Use as few words as possible in each sketch, relying instead on **simple symbols** (arrows, stick figures etc.).

Each sketch should help answer the following questions:

* Where does the testing take place?
* What details are you tracking for each test and individual?
* How often are you collecting test results? Daily? Weekly?
* How do you make sure you're testing the right people?
* What do you do with the test results once you collect them?

At the end of the 15 minutes, each group should take about 5 minutes to present their sketch to the class.
