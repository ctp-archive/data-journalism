# Systems thinking - Hands-on exercises

The United States needs a plan for detecting the spread of the Z virus, and the goal of this exercise is for your class to draft one on paper.

## Part II - Intergovernmental affairs

As a class, use the sketches from each political division to sketch out a **new system**: a plan for how the federal government should aggregate this data from the **state level** to the **national level**.

As you work, consider the following questions as a class:

* How do the inputs and outputs of your systems differ?
* How often are you collecting the data? Daily? Weekly?
* How do the systems you set up **individually** fit **together**?
* What changes do you need to make for them to be compatible?

After you've created a plan, answer the following discussion questions as a class:

* What details and measurements are lost when comparing state to state?
* How trustworthy is the data aggregated at the highest level?
* How should you share the data publicly?
* We only dealt with two divisions of the political system: state and federal governments. How might the system get more complex if we added in city and county governments?
