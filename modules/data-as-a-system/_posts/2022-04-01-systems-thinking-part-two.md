# Combining systems

***Total suggested time: 50 minutes***

The United States needs a plan for aggregating the results of each state's system for detecting the spread of the Z virus, and the goal of this exercise is for your class to figure out how to collect that data.

## Class exercise: Inputs and outputs

*Suggested time: 30 minutes*

As a class, use the sketches from each political division to sketch out a **new system**: a plan for how the federal government should aggregate this data from the **state level** to the **national level**.

> **For instructors:** Whether students used digital or physical sketches, find a way to show as many of their individual diagrams to the whole class (post them on the board, combine them in a Google slide etc.) to aid in sketching the new, expanded system.

As you work, consider the following questions as a class:

* How do the inputs and outputs of your systems differ?
* How often are you collecting the data? Daily? Weekly?
* How do the systems you set up **individually** fit **together**?
* What changes do you need to make for them to be compatible?

## Class discussion: Considering complexity

*Suggested time: 20 minutes*

After you've created a plan, answer the following discussion questions as a class:

* What details and measurements are lost when comparing state to state?
* How trustworthy is the data aggregated at the highest level?
* How should you share the data publicly?
* We only dealt with two divisions of the political system: state and federal governments. How might the system get more complex if we added in city and county governments?
