This course was designed and created by [Tyler Dukes](http://mtdukes.com/) for the [COVID Tracking Project Archive](https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/covid-19-pandemic/the-covid-tracking-project-archive/) housed at the University of California, San Francisco Archives and Special Collections. It was funded by a [data engagement award](https://www.nnlm.gov/about/regions/region5) from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Region 5 under the direction of USCF Archivist and Associate University Librarian for Collections Polina Ilieva and UCSF Library.

Funding for this project was provided in part by the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/) (Sloan grant G-2022-17133).

This project is indebted to the work and feedback of data journalism experts and educators Sarah Cohen, Derek Willis, Meredith Broussard, Ryan Thornburg, Alex Richards, Nausheen Husain and Katie Dukes.
