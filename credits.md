This course was designed and created by [Tyler Dukes](http://mtdukes.com/) for the [COVID Tracking Project Archive](https://www.library.ucsf.edu/archives/covid-19-pandemic/the-covid-tracking-project-archive/) housed at the University of California San Francisco Archives and Special Collections. It was funded by a [data engagement award](https://www.nnlm.gov/about/regions/region5) from the National Network of Libraries of Medicine Region 5 under the direction of USCF Archivist and Associate University Librarian for Collections Polina Ilieva.

This project is indebted to the work and feedback of data journalism experts and educators Sarah Cohen, Derek Willis, Meredith Broussard, Ryan Thornburg, Alex Richards and Katie Dukes.
