Welcome to the COVID data journalism course-in-a-box from the COVID Tracking Project Archive, housed at the University of California, San Fransisco. This course contains five modules aimed at using content from the COVID Tracking Project to learn the conceptual foundations of data journalism.

Although the content of this course is targeted primarily toward data journalism educators on the undergraduate level, all the materials here are open for use to anyone interested in learning or teaching data journalism.

If you use any components of this course, please consider [taking our survey](https://ucsf.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2mWh1W6AWqApLo2) to help us refine the content.

## Course material

The course itself is split into five modules.

Data as a system
: Before working with data, data journalists need to develop an ability to think critically about its strengths and weaknesses. And thinking of data as one part of a larger system can help.

Spreadsheets
: Spreadsheets are a foundation of data journalism, and much of what you’ll learn in this module will look familiar when working with data in other formats and in other platforms.

Liberating data
: Data doesn’t always arrive ready to analyze. A data journalist’s job often involves collecting data from multiple sources or transforming it from unwieldy formats to something more structured.

Intro to R
: The statistical programming language R is quickly becoming one of the standard tools for data journalists around the world. Its use can help us expand our understand of data and how to analyze it.

The weight of data
: Data is more than just numbers – it’s an attempt to quantify often emotional aspects of humanity, like loss and illness. Data journalists should be prepared for the implications of working with and presenting these numbers, both on themselves and their audiences.

## Course structure

Modules are designed to take about a week, assuming about two hours of class meetings each week.

Depending on the content, each of this course's five modules contains a mix of submodules.

The setup
: Lays out module objectives, the tools you'll need and the details on any datasets used in the modules

Walkthroughs
: Step-by-step instructions for working with data or tools for students to work through on their own asynchronously or with guided instruction in class

Exercises
: Questions and discussion tackled as a class or tasks students complete and answer individually or in small groups with new data or novel archival material.

Tips & further reading
: A handy page to bookmark for assorted cheatsheets and extra resources on the topic

The content in this course is designed to be used either:
* From start to finish in a **full, standalone course** 
* As indivudual modules integrated into an **existing course**.
